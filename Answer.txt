Question 1
(a)
Intercept (α): 95.97
Average Treatment Effect (τ): −9.11
Spending coefficient (β): 1.51

(b) Estimated ATE and Statistical Significance
Estimated ATE (τ̂): −9.11
p-value for τ̂: 0.0004
This result is statistically significant (p < 0.05), 
indicating strong evidence that participating in the carbon offset program is associated with a reduction in stakeholder engagement score by approximately 9.11 points, all else being equal.

(c)
Unconfoundedness (Ignorability):
Treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes given sustainability spending.
Overlap (Positivity):
For all levels of X, there must be both treated and untreated units.
Correct model specification:
The linear model form must be appropriate and include all relevant covariates.

Under these assumptions, τ̂ can be interpreted as the Average Treatment Effect (ATE).

Question 2
Predict Output:
{
  "W": 1.0,
  "X": 20.0,
  "predicted_engagement": 117.16
}
This means a company participating in the carbon offset program and spending $20,000 on sustainability is predicted to have a stakeholder engagement score of 117.16.
